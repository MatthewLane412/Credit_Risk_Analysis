# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview

In this analysis we are attempting to solve a real world problem for credit risk. Using machine learning and statistical reasoning we are trying to use supervised machine learning to automate the prediction process of credit risk. Some of the libraries used include, imbalanced-learn, scikit-learn, RandomOverSampler, SMOTE, ClusteredCentroids, SMOTEENN, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier.
